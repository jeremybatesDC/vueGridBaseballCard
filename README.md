#Make Github Cards
#Try to get all fields at 16px and/or min size to avoid iOS zoom
#Or embrance it and make them all zoom, maybe even by using these focus styles to make a modal-ish thing. There could be a button to blur which would result in it closing. One single input brought to the fore is good ui I think.
